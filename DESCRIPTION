Description: When building complex models, it is often difficult to explain why
    the model should be trusted. While global measures such as accuracy are 
    useful, they cannot be used for explaining why a model made a specific 
    prediction. `lime` (a port of the `lime` Python package) is a method for
    explaining the outcome of black box models by fitting a local model around
    the point in question an pertubations of this point.
