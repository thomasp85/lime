### abstract ###
AIMX We propose a nonparametric Bayesian factor regression model that accounts for uncertainty in the number of factors, and the relationship between factors
BASE To accomplish this, we propose a sparse variant of the Indian Buffet Process and couple this with a hierarchical model over factors, based on Kingman's coalescent
OWNX We apply this model to two problems (factor analysis and factor regression) in gene-expression data analysis
### introduction ###
MISC Factor analysis is the task of explaining data by means of a set of  latent factors
MISC Factor  regression  couples this analysis with a prediction task, where the predictions are made solely on the basis of the factor representation
MISC The latent factor representation achieves two-fold benefits: (1) discovering the latent  process  underlying the data; (2) simpler predictive modeling through a compact data representation
MISC In particular, (2) is motivated by the problem of prediction in the  ``large P small N''  paradigm  CITATION , where the number of features  SYMBOL  greatly exceeds the number of examples  SYMBOL , potentially resulting in overfitting
CONT We address three fundamental shortcomings of standard factor analysis approaches  CITATION : (1) we do not assume a known number of factors; (2) we do not assume factors are independent; (3) we do not assume all features are relevant to the factor analysis
OWNX Our motivation for this work stems from the task of reconstructing regulatory structure from gene-expression data
OWNX In this context, factors correspond to regulatory pathways
OWNX Our contributions thus parallel the needs of gene pathway modeling
OWNX In addition, we couple predictive modeling (for factor regression) within the factor analysis framework itself, instead of having to model it separately
OWNX Our factor regression model is fundamentally nonparametric
OWNX In particular, we treat the gene-to-factor relationship nonparametrically by proposing a sparse variant of the Indian Buffet Process (IBP)  CITATION , designed to account for the sparsity of relevant genes (features)
OWNX We  couple  this IBP with a hierarchical prior over the factors
OWNX This prior explains the fact that pathways are fundamentally related: some are involved in transcription, some in signaling, some in synthesis
OWNX The nonparametric nature of our sparse IBP requires that the hierarchical prior  also  be nonparametric
MISC A natural choice is Kingman's coalescent  CITATION , a popular distribution over infinite binary trees
OWNX Since our motivation is an application in bioinformatics, our notation and terminology will be drawn from that area
OWNX In particular,  genes  are  features ,  samples  are  examples , and  pathways  are  factors
OWNX However, our model is more general
OWNX An alternative application might be to a collaborative filtering problem, in which case our genes might correspond to movies, our samples might correspond to users and our pathways might correspond to genres
OWNX In this context, all three contributions of our model still make sense: we do not know how many movie genres there are; some genres are closely related (romance to comedy versus to action); many movies may be spurious
