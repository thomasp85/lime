### abstract ###
AIMX	the paper extends research on fixed-pie perceptions by suggesting that disputants may prefer proposals that are perceived to be equally attractive to both parties i e , balanced rather than one-sided, because balanced agreements are seen as more likely to be successfully implemented
OWNX	we test our predictions using data on israeli support for the geneva accords, an agreement for a two state solution negotiated by unofficial delegations of israel and the palestinian authority in 2003
OWNX	the results demonstrate that israelis are more likely to support agreements that are seen favorably by other israelis, but - contrary to fixed-pie predictions - israeli support for the accords does not diminish simply because a majority of palestinians favors rather than opposes the accords
AIMX	we show that implementation concerns create a demand among israelis for balance in the degree to which each side favors or opposes the agreement
OWNX	the effect of balance is noteworthy in that it creates considerable support for proposals even when a majority of israelis and palestinians oppose the deal
### introduction ###
MISC	normative models of bargaining and negotiation suggest that if there is potential for mutual benefit, conflicting parties should be able to achieve it  CITATION
CONT	descriptive accounts and empirical investigations of negotiation behavior  CITATION , however, suggest that a number of psychological barriers to conflict resolution are likely to make efficient deal making difficult  CITATION
MISC	for example, research on cognitive biases associated with egocentric perceptions suggests that negotiators and evaluators of negotiated agreements are likely to exhibit a "fixed-pie bias"  CITATION
MISC	the fixed-pie bias refers to the belief that any gain for one party will be associated with an equivalent loss to the other party
CONT	this belief is a "bias" when it persists even in contexts where there is a possibility of compatible interests or mutual benefit
MISC	a large body of research finds that negotiators are susceptible to the fixed-pie bias prior to, during, and even after negotiations  CITATION
AIMX	in the current paper we investigate and extend research on fixed pie bias in the context of protracted intergroup conflict
