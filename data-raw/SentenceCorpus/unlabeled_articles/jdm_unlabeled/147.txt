### abstract ###
according to recent dual-process theories  interpersonal trust is influenced by both impulsive and deliberative processes
the present research explores the determinants of deliberative trust  investigating how trust decisions are affected by the availability of cognitive resources
we test the interaction of two relevant factors  self-control the ability to exert mental control over one's behavior and the default response a preselected option that requires minimal or no effort
past research has shown that self-control has extensive effects on social behavior and decision making
here  we report that the effect of self-control on trust depends on the default
across two studies  we find no direct link between self-control and trust
instead  self-control affects trust indirectly by influencing the level of effort in decision making
poor self-control due to experimental depletion or trait-based differences predicts adherence to the default-the response that requires the least effort
### introduction ###
interpersonal trust plays an important role in myriad contexts  from economic exchanges and organizational settings to friendships and romantic relationships  CITATION
the factors that influence trust can vary significantly across these domains  CITATION
to account for this variance  past research has noted the differences between the emotional and cognitive aspects of trust  CITATION
more recently  murray and colleagues  CITATION  proposed a dual-process model of trust  separating trust into impulsive and deliberative components
the deliberative aspect of trust often depends on complex considerations
a potential trustor might consider the risk of the situation  as well as the ability  benevolence  and integrity of the trusted party  CITATION
ultimately  the trustor has to decide if  given the parameters of the situation  trusting is worth the risk
if the trustor intends to be thorough about this decision  the process could require a significant investment of time and effort
the present research investigates how trust decisions change when the ability to deliberate is compromised
we focus on two factors that interactively affect deliberative trust  self-control the ability to exert cognitive control over one's behavior and the default response the preselected option that requires the least amount of effort
