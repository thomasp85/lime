### abstract ###
currently  a disparity exists between the process-level models decision researchers use to describe and predict decision behavior and the methods implemented and metrics collected to test these models
the current work seeks to remedy this disparity by combining the advantages of work in decision research mouse-tracing paradigms with contingent information display and cognitive psychology eye-tracking paradigms from reading and scene perception
in particular  we introduce a new decision moving-window paradigm that presents stimulus information contingent on eye fixations
we provide data from the first application of this method to risky decision making  and show how it compares to basic eye-tracking and mouse-tracing methods
we also enumerate the practical  theoretical  and analytic advantages this method offers above and beyond both mouse-tracing with occlusion and basic eye tracking of information without occlusion
we include the use of new metrics that offer more precision than those typically calculated on mouse-tracing data as well as those not possible or feasible within the mouse-tracing paradigm
### introduction ###
decision researchers must often rely on outcome measures i e   choice  preference  etc
to infer how decisions are made by individuals
the advent of increased computing power  availability  and usability has allowed decision researchers to develop methods to examine underlying processes attention  information acquisition  deliberation  etc
rather than relying solely on observable outcomes
process-tracing paradigms such as information boards and mouse-tracing methods  CITATION   eye-tracking methods  CITATION   and verbal protocols  CITATION  have been utilized in decision research as mechanisms for capturing the decision process
the need to verify theoretical advances that specify how i e   process in addition to what i e   outcome has produced a great interest in tracing methods  CITATION
