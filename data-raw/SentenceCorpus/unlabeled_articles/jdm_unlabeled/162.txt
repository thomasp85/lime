### abstract ###
in three studies  we examined factors that may temporarily attenuate information search
people are generally curious and dislike uncertainty  which typically encourages them to look for relevant information
despite these strong forces that promote information search  people sometimes deliberately delay obtaining valuable information
we find they may do so when they are concerned that the information might interfere with future pleasurable activities
interestingly  the decision to search or to postpone searching for information is influenced not only by the value and importance of the information itself but also by well-being maintenance goals related to possible detrimental effects that negative knowledge may have on unrelated future plans
### introduction ###
yet ah
why should they know their fate
since sorrow never comes too late  and happiness too swiftly flies
thought would destroy their paradise
no more  where ignorance is bliss  'tis folly to be wise
-thomas gray  CITATION   ode on a distant prospect of eton college thomas gray's ode on a distant prospect of eton suggests that because happy moments are rare and short lived  and because it is only a matter of time before we have to face the painful truth or experience rumination  we should sometimes prefer ignorance over knowledge
consistent with this notion  we provide here three empirical demonstrations of people thinking and behaving in accordance with the belief that sometimes  'tis folly to be wise
 in the present research we examined factors influencing decisions to avoid valuable information
we hypothesized that  when potentially negative information could interfere with future pleasurable plans  people would temporarily avoid this information until after the event had ended
specifically  we suggest the choice to avoid potentially negative information is at least partly determined by well-being maintenance goals i e   enjoyment of future events
consider  for instance  the case of receiving an envelope from the tax authority while getting ready to catch the plane for a weekend out in las vegas
opening the envelope is wise  as knowing if the letter brings bad news can help one make well-informed financial decisions
indeed  because of the importance of making well-informed decisions people generally exhibit strong curiosity and search for information  CITATION
however  we think that people are less likely to open the envelope when it arrives just before they head to vegas  in order to avoid spoiling the trip
importantly  putting off information search-leaving the envelope closed at home-is not a guarantee for a peaceful weekend either  as the uncertainty and associated rumination can also ruin the trip
in such cases  individuals might thus prefer to resolve uncertainty before the trip
what then determines whether people would search or avoid information
we propose that  when deciding whether or not to expose themselves to information  people weigh the expected costs of knowing against those of ignorance
thus individuals determine whether certainty or uncertainty is worse and hence search or avoid information
