### abstract ###
in this paper  i trace the evolution of the aircraft cockpit as an example of the transformation of a probabilistic environment into an ecological hybrid  that is  an environment characterized by both probabilistic and deterministic features and elements
in the hybrid ecology  the relationships among correspondence and coherence strategies and goals and cognitive tactics on the continuum from intuition to analysis become critically important
intuitive tactics used to achieve correspondence in the physical world do not work in the electronic world
rather  i make the case that judgment and decision making in a hybrid ecology requires coherence as the primary strategy to achieve correspondence  and that this process requires a shift in tactics from intuition toward analysis
### introduction ###
we live in a correspondence-driven world  in which the actual state of the world imposes constraints on interactions within it  CITATION
in correspondence-driven domains  judgments - how far away and how high is that obstacle
what is the correct diagnosis given these symptoms
where is the enemy force likely to attack
- are guided by multiple probabilistic and fallible indicators in the physical world
survival depends on the correspondence or accuracy of our judgment  that is  how well it corresponds to objective reality
the increasing availability of sophisticated technological systems  however  has profoundly altered the character of many correspondence-driven environments  such as aviation  medicine  military operations  or nuclear power  as well as the processes of judgments and decision making within them
in this paper  i trace the evolution of the aircraft cockpit as an example of the transformation of a probabilistic environment into an ecological hybrid  that is  an environment characterized by both probabilistic and deterministic features and elements
as technology has changed the nature of cues and information available to the pilot  it has also changed the strategies and tactics pilots must use to make judgments successfully
i make the case that judgment and decision making in a hybrid ecology requires coherence as the primary strategy to achieve correspondence  and that this process requires a shift in tactics from intuition toward analysis
the recognition of these changes carries implications for research models in high-technology environments  as well as for the design of systems and decision aids
