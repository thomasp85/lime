### abstract ###
hammond  CITATION  argued that much of the research in the field of judgment and decision making jdm can be categorized as focused on either coherence or correspondence c and c and that  in order to understand the findings of the field  one needs to understand the differences between these two criteria
hammond's claim is that conclusions about the competence of judgments and decisions will depend upon the selection of coherence or correspondence as the criterion  CITATION
first  i provide an overview of the terms coherence and correspondence c and c as philosophical theories of truth and relate them to the field of jdm
second  i provide an example of hammond's claim by examining literature on base rate neglect
third  i examine hammond's claim as it applies to the broader field of jdm
fourth  i critique hammond's claim and suggest that refinements to the c and c distinction are needed
specifically  the c and c distinction  NUMBER  is more accurately applied to criteria than to researchers   NUMBER  should be refined to include two important types of coherence inter and intrapersonal coherence and  NUMBER  neglects the third philosophical theory of truth  pragmatism
pragmatism  as a class of criteria in jdm  is defined as goal attainment
in order to provide the most complete assessment of human judgment possible  and understand different findings in the field of jdm  all three criteria should be considered
### introduction ###
hammond  CITATION  argued that there are two main camps of researchers in the field of judgment and decision making jdm who have each adopted different criteria for assessing the competence of human judgments and decisions
according to hammond  CITATION  researchers in the brunswikian tradition tend to emphasize the correspondence of judgment with ecological criteria  CITATION  while researchers in the heuristics and biases h and b program tend to assess coherence  CITATION
hammond's claim is that conclusions about the competence of judgments and decisions will depend upon the selection of coherence or correspondence as the criterion  CITATION
hammond stated that  understanding the important field of human judgment cannot go forward  cannot eliminate the current disarray  without our acknowledging the role of coherence and correspondence   CITATION
this is a strong claim and the focus of this paper is the evaluation of this claim
first  i provide an overview and brief history of the terms coherence and correspondence c and c as philosophical theories of truth and as they relate to jdm
second  i provide an example of hammond's claim by examining some of the literature on base rate neglect
third  i examine hammond's claim as it applies to the broader field of jdm
fourth  i critique hammond's claim and suggest that refinements to the c and c distinction are needed
specifically  i point out there are two important types of coherence and that a third philosophical theory of truth  pragmatism  is needed to complete the framework
