### abstract ###
the current study is based on a field study of the  NUMBER  israel-lebanon war that was conducted in two waves  the first two weeks after the end of the war  and the second  NUMBER  months later  CITATION
the purpose of the study was to examine recalled emotions and perceived risks induced by manipulation using a short videoclip that recalled the sounds of the alarms and the sights of the missile attacks during the war
before filling in the study questionnaire in  NUMBER   the experimental group watched a short videoclip recalling the events of the war
the control group did not watch the video before filling in the questionnaire
using the data provided by questionnaires  we analyzed the effect of recalled emotions on perceived risks in two different regions in israel  the northern region  which was under missile attack daily during the war  and the central region  which was not under missile attacks
the videoclip had a strong effect on the level of recalled emotions in both regions  but it did not affect risk judgments
the results of the analytical framework in the northern region support both the valence approach  in which negative emotion increases pessimism about risk  CITATION   and the modified appraisal tendency theory  which implies different effects for different emotions  CITATION
the current study emphasizes the effects of recalled emotion in the context of the  NUMBER  israel-lebanon war on perceived risks among those in the northern region who were under direct attack compared to those who were not directly exposed to the war
understanding people's responses to stressful events is crucial  not only when these events take place but also over time  since media-induced emotions can influence appraisals and decisions regarding public policies
### introduction ###
the current study is based on a field study of the  CITATION  israel-lebanon war
the study examines recalled emotions and perceived risks  NUMBER  months after the end of the war in two regions in israel  the northern region  which was under missile attack daily during the war  and the central region  which was not under missile attacks
the israel-lebanon war of july-august  NUMBER  affected the lives of israelis living in the north of israel  which was hit by massive barrages of missiles sent by hezbollah militias
many civilians were injured  some lost their homes  and  NUMBER  lost their lives
in effect  the region's economy was paralyzed  and most places of work remained closed
indeed  the war had an indirect impact upon the entire country
naturally  the attacks generated anger  fear  and other negative emotions among the population
in a  NUMBER  study  we examined the effects of the  NUMBER  israel-lebanon war on emotions and self-risk perceptions among civilians living in two regions  the north  which was under missile attack during the war  and the center  which was unaffected by the missiles  CITATION
in the current study we compare the emotions and risk judgments of individuals made at that time  NUMBER  with the recalled emotions and risk perception of individuals from the same two regions  NUMBER  months later
the first wave of the study was conducted in september  NUMBER   CITATION   while the second wave was in march  NUMBER    NUMBER  months after the end of the war
in addition  for one of the sub-groups in the  NUMBER  sample we used an experimental design that included a short videoclip recalling the sounds of the alarms and the sights of the missile attacks during the  NUMBER  war
participants in this group filled in a questionnaire about recalled emotions and future risk judgment after watching this videoclip
comparing the samples from  NUMBER  and  NUMBER  with and without the videoclip enables us to examine  in addition  the sample data enable us to compare two theoretical approaches  the valence approach  CITATION  and a version of the appraisal tendency approach  CITATION
the paper is organized as follows  section  NUMBER  presents the literature review  section  NUMBER  describes the main hypotheses of the study  and section  NUMBER  describes the methods
