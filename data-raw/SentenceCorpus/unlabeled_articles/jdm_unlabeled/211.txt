### abstract ###
inclusion and exclusion strategies for allocation of scarce goods involve different processes
the conditions under which one strategy is chosen in favor of the other  however  have not been fully explicated
in the present study  decision makers chose a single strategy after reading through descriptions of  NUMBER  potential organ recipients  they then narrowed the list of transplant candidates
most liberals chose to use exclusion under conditions of abundance and inclusion under scarcity
in contrast  conservatives preferred an inclusion strategy under abundance and exclusion though not significantly under scarcity
theoretical implications as well as ongoing work in inclusion-exclusion strategy choice  political ideology  and distributive justice are discussed
### introduction ###
suppose you were the director of a hospital's organ allocation team
your job is to determine who among those patients awaiting organ transplants should be given priority for the organs that are currently available
how would you decide
one possible strategy might be to decide which candidates are  in the running
  that is  you would select or  include  the patients who you think should be seriously considered for an immediate organ transplant
the other strategy might be to decide which candidates are  out of the running
  in other words  you would eliminate or  exclude  those patients who you think should not be seriously considered for an immediate organ transplant
previous research suggests that if you use an inclusion rather than exclusion strategy you will end up with a smaller consideration set  i e   more candidates will be screened out  CITATION   and you will expend more effort  CITATION
research also suggests that  under certain contexts  decision makers may have a natural preference for one strategy over the other  CITATION
