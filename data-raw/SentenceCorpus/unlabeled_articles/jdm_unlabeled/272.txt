### abstract ###
we compared south koreans with australians in order to characterize cultural differences in attitudes and choices regarding risk  at both the individual and group levels
our results showed that australians  when assessed individually  consistently self-reported higher preference for risk than south koreans  regardless of gender
the data revealed that south koreans  regardless of gender composition  were willing to take greater risks when making decisions in group decision-making situations than when they were alone
this is a different pattern from that seen in the australian sample  in which a risky shift was noted only among males
this difference was attributed to the influence of various cultural orientations independent vs interdependent relationship styles
this study also provides a discussion of the implications of these results in terms of cultural differences in attitudes and decisions regarding risk
### introduction ###
it has been frequently observed  and generally accepted  that males are more likely than females to engage in risk-taking behaviors
males participate more frequently than females in a variety of risky activities  including drinking alcohol and smoking korea national statistical office  knso    NUMBER 
road traffic mortality rates are higher for males than females road traffic authority  rta    NUMBER 
similar patterns in road traffic accidents have been noted in the americas  europe  asia  and africa world health organization  who    NUMBER   who   NUMBER 
consistent with these observed phenomena  a meta-analysis of  NUMBER  studies of risk-taking has also suggested the existence of reliable gender differences in self-reported behavior  hypothetical choice  and observed behaviors  although the magnitude of cohen's effect size was relatively small for each category  CITATION  and there is some variation from category to category  CITATION
in this study  we have attempted to determine  from a cross-cultural perspective  the manner in which the attitudes and choices regarding risk made by collectivists - specifically  south koreans - differ from those of individualists - in this case  australians - at both the individual and group levels
