### abstract ###
the theory of planned behaviour  CITATION  is based on a utility framework  and the risk-as-feelings hypothesis  CITATION  is a feelings-based behavioural model
the tpb and raf are first compared and contrasted
two empirical studies investigated the predictive power of consequence-based vs affect-based evaluative judgements for behavioural intentions  study  NUMBER  n    NUMBER  applied a regression model to examine the predictive value of a subset of shared variables  unique tpb variables  and unique raf variables for intentions to have unsafe sex
study  NUMBER  n    NUMBER  experimentally examined whether intentions are driven by consequences or feelings  in two decision vignettes with opposite qualities  a positive hedonic experience with potential negative consequences unsafe sex vs a negative hedonic experience with potential positive consequences back surgery
the results supported the tpb by emphasising the role of outcome-expectations in the construction of intentions  and the raf by showing the importance of affective subcomponents in attitudes
### introduction ###
humans sometimes act in order to reach an outcome  and other times out of enjoyment for the activity itself
this difference has been referred to as extrinsic vs intrinsic motivation  CITATION   incentives vs motivation  CITATION   and utilitarian vs hedonically driven behaviour  CITATION   and represents a general dichotomy between action as goal and action as mean towards a goal
there is often a conflict between the hedonic quality of the behaviour and its consequences
although hedonic qualities could be seen as a particular kind of behavioural consequence  the experiential part of such a displeasure is  by definition  in the present  whereas other behavioural outputs lie in the future
thus  one suggested underlying mechanism for the tension between behaviour and consequences is the fundamental difference in time perspective associated with ongoing activities and their consequences
it has been suggested that the need for self-regulation exists in most individuals due to an inconsistency between short- and long-term consequences of an option  CITATION
intertemporal discounting exemplifies one such failure to balance the subjective value of immediate to more distant goals  and a systematic devaluation of future as opposed to immediate outcomes  CITATION
the present paper focuses on dilemmas where the values associated with the performance of the behaviour and the values of the consequences are in conflict  even when holding time-perspective constant
several theoretical accounts may shed light on the difference between actions as goals or as means
meta-theories of human motivation  such as self-determination theory  CITATION  centre on motivational mechanisms  claiming that a set of basic motivational needs drive behaviour
the need for competence  autonomy  and belongingness are proposed as general behavioural driving forces  fairly independently of time-perspectives
thus  in addition to motivation towards mastery and independence  social norms direct our behaviour
the most socially accepted action is the default option  and complying with it may not be experienced as decision making
other theories focus on preventing factors  such as cognitive limitations
to this end  several dual-process theories  CITATION  demonstrate our ability and unique human predisposition to pay attention to potentially contradictory sources of information  e g   affective experiential vs reason based consequential
these authors  CITATION  circumvent the issue of time perspective indirectly  by showing how the intuitive  basic  and effortless experiential heuristic system for processing is faster than the intentional  reason-based  and effortful rational analytical system
the rapid processing of affective and immediate information may result in behaviour which is more inclined to follow the affective rather than the analytical system
there is ample evidence that intentions may be directed at activities just for the pleasure of it  with little consideration of the potential consequences  e g   smoking  heavy drinking  unsafe sex  hazardous driving  and unhealthy eating
on the basis of this tension between consequences and feelings  the present study set out to compare and contrast two theoretical psychological frameworks  which identify key structures and processes of planned- and feelings-based behaviour  the theory of planned behaviour  CITATION  and the risk-as-feelings hypothesis  CITATION
furthermore  we aimed at an empirical investigation of core predictors for behavioural intentions in decision making under ambivalence
decision ambivalence is here defined as perceived tension between the hedonic quality of the behaviour and its potential consequences in behavioural choices
the present paper is organized as the following  the two theoretical frameworks are presented first  followed by a theoretical analysis which separates their basic components into shared and unique variables
then  we present the outline and results of two empirical studies  investigating the predictive power of the models
next  we discuss the findings in light of the theoretical frameworks and the reviewed literature
